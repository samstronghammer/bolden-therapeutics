    <p>
      Bolden Therapeutics is a biotechnology company developing first-in-class therapeutics 
      to treat central nervous system diseases such as Alzheimer’s and ischemic stroke. 
      The company’s scientific founders, Dr. Justin Fallon and Dr. Ashley Webb, have identified 
      a key molecular pathway to stimulate neural stem cells to promote the birth of new neurons 
      (neurogenesis) in the adult brain. In a proprietary mouse model Bolden has established 
      proof-of-concept of this approach to increase neurogenesis and enhance hippocampal-dependent 
      memory. The company is developing antisense oligonucleotide and monoclonal antibody 
      therapeutics to modulate this pathway.
