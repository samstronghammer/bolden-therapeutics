“We are honored to have been awarded the Biogen-LabCentral Golden Ticket,” said Johnny Page, co-founder and CEO of Bolden. “The award provides us with laboratory space at LabCentral, in the heart of Kendall Square, Cambridge, MA. This is a considerable opportunity to advance our research, and also we are fortunate to be able to seek guidance from Biogen’s expert scientists as our program progresses. We anticipate a productive year ahead as we further characterize drug candidates to promote neurogenesis with the hope that they may ultimately assist patients suffering from intractable neurological diseases.” 

“Based on our findings thus far, we are very excited about the potential of our approach for the treatment of Alzheimer’s disease and other neurological conditions,” said Dr. Charles Polsky, Bolden’s Executive Chairman. “The Golden Ticket award will enable Bolden to accelerate its preclinical drug development and to access myriad human resources in Cambridge’s biotech ecosystem.” 

Bolden’s scientific approach is focused on increasing the formation of new neurons in the adult brain (‘neurogenesis’) via targeting endogenous neural stem cells. “At Bolden, our mission is to develop therapeutics to promote neurogenesis for the treatment of disease,” said Dr. Justin Fallon, scientific co-founder and chair of Bolden’s Scientific Advisory Board. “Our new research facility will expand our capabilities and assist in generating additional data towards our mission.”

Starting in mid-February, Bolden will occupy its space within the LabCentral shared research facility in Cambridge, MA. As a winner of the Biogen Golden Ticket, Bolden will take up residence at LabCentral for a year at no cost to Bolden for lab space and membership.

Bolden has created a strong scientific advisory board to take full advantage of this opportunity and to maximize the chance of success in upcoming preclinical studies. The scientific advisory board consists of its scientific co-founders Dr. Justin Fallon (chair) and Dr. Ashley Webb, as well as Dr. Sudhir Agrawal and Dr. Steve Salloway. Dr. Fallon is highly experienced in basic and translational research for neurological and neurodegenerative diseases. Dr. Webb has published widely on neural stem cell homeostasis and cellular mechanisms of aging. Dr. Agrawal is a renowned leader in the fields of RNA therapeutics and antisense oligonucleotides, and his guidance will be critical for informing our future experiments. Dr. Salloway is a leading expert in Alzheimer’s disease clinical trials, and his expertise will be invaluable as we work to bring our drug candidates into the clinic.

### About Bolden Therapeutics, Inc.
Bolden Therapeutics is a biotechnology company developing first-in-class therapeutics to treat central nervous system diseases such as Alzheimer’s and ischemic stroke. The company’s scientific co-founders, Dr. Justin Fallon and Dr. Ashley Webb, have identified a key molecular pathway to stimulate neural stem cells to promote the birth of new neurons (neurogenesis) in the adult brain. In a proprietary mouse model Bolden has established proof-of-concept of this approach to increase neurogenesis and enhance hippocampal-dependent memory. The company is developing antisense oligonucleotide and monoclonal antibody therapeutics to modulate this pathway.
