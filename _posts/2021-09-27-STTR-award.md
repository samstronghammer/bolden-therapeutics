PROVIDENCE, RI & CAMBRIDGE, MA. Bolden Therapeutics, Inc., a biotechnology company developing first-in-class therapeutics to promote neurogenesis for potential treatment of CNS diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease, today announced receiving a $500,000 Phase I Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) grant from the National Institute on Aging of the National Institutes of Health.

“We are thrilled to have received this important grant funding for Alzheimer’ disease research from the National Institute on Aging,” said Johnny Page, co-founder and CEO of Bolden Therapeutics. “These funds will allow us to expand our research team in Cambridge. They will also broaden our pipeline of potential therapeutic candidates as we work toward our ultimate goal of developing therapies to improve the lives of patients suffering from Alzheimer’s disease.” 

“The award of this STTR grant will support the development of an exciting new approach to promote the growth of new nerve cells to enhance memory in patients with Alzheimer’s disease led by key faculty in the Carney Institute for Brain Science at Brown,” said Dr. Stephen Salloway, Bolden’s scientific advisor and Associate Director of the Brown Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center. “This work closely aligns with the goal of Brown’s new Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center to support discovery science that leads to breakthroughs for Alzheimer’s Disease.”

The work funded by this grant award will be performed in collaboration with the Fallon and Webb Labs of Brown University. Bolden has recently completed its exclusive license of multiple foundational patents from Brown University. “This work continues to show Brown’s research distinction, particularly in the neuro space,” said Neil Veloso, executive director of Brown Technology Innovations. “We look forward to Bolden’s further development of this important work.” 


### About Bolden Therapeutics, Inc.
Bolden Therapeutics is a biotechnology company developing first-in-class therapeutics to treat central nervous system diseases such as Alzheimer’s and other disorders of cognition. The company’s scientific co-founders, Dr. Justin Fallon and Dr. Ashley Webb, have identified a key molecular pathway to stimulate neural stem cells to promote the birth of new neurons (neurogenesis) in the adult brain. In a proprietary mouse model Bolden has established proof-of-concept of this approach to increase neurogenesis and enhance hippocampal-dependent memory. The company is exploring multiple methods of modulating this pathway, leading with antisense oligonucleotides.
