  title: Overview
  content: "Bolden’s scientific founders have identified a key molecular pathway to promote 
  the birth of new neurons (neurogenesis) in the adult brain. In a proprietary mouse model 
  Bolden has established proof-of-concept of this approach to increase neurogenesis and 
  enhance hippocampal-dependent memory."

  title: Background
  content: "Neurogenesis has been extensively studied in animals, and is believed to play an 
  important role in learning and memory. Diminished neurogenesis can contribute to cognitive 
  dysfunction and memory impairment, and this phenomenon is observed in multiple neurodegenerative 
  diseases and neurological conditions. In addition, neurogenesis has been implicated as important 
  for functional recovery following traumatic brain injury and ischemic stroke."

  title: Target Indications
  content: "Due to the nature of neurogenesis as a target, there are a multitude of potential 
  clinical applications for neurogenesis-promoting therapies such as those we aim to develop. 
  These include but are not limited to: Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias, ischemic 
  stroke, treatment-resistant depression, Huntington’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, traumatic 
  brain injury, and cognitive impairment following chemotherapy."
