  title: Background
  content: Our research focuses on pathological states in which the formation of new neurons in the adult brain – termed “adult neurogenesis” (AN) – declines. Diminished AN can contribute to cognitive dysfunction and memory loss in numerous diseases. In addition, AN has been implicated as important for functional recovery following traumatic brain injury (TBI) and ischemic stroke. Intuitively, augmenting AN represents an attractive approach for therapy in multiple indications.

  title: Target Indications
  content: "Given the multitude of potential clinical applications of a pro-neurogenic therapy, there are several patient populations that our approach may help treat. These include but are not limited to: Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias, treatment-resistant depression, post-traumatic stress disorder, stroke recovery, traumatic brain injury."
