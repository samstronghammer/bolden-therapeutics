- title: Adult Hippocampal Neurogenesis (AHN)
  content: "AHN occurs in virtually all mammals, including humans (Eriksson et al., 1998; 
  Spalding et al., 2013; Ernst et al., 2014; Moreno-Jiménez et al., 2019; Babcock et al., 
  2021). These newborn neurons are highly plastic and provide a uniquely rich substrate 
  for mediating learning and memory in the critical information processing node between 
  entorhinal inputs and the hippocampal tri-synaptic circuit. Extensive work in rodent 
  models shows that adult neurogenesis supports learning and memory, sensory functions 
  and mood regulation (Enwere et al., 2004; Gage, 2019; Imayoshi et al., 2008; Zhang et 
  al., 2008). 

  Neural stem cells (NSCs) are the endogenous source of new neurons. NSCs reside in two 
  neurogenic niches: the subgranular zone (SGZ) in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus and 
  the subventricular zone (SVZ) lining the lateral ventricles. Most NSCs reside in a 
  dormant state termed quiescence. Neurogenesis is initiated when quiescent NSCs become 
  activated in response to extrinsic or intrinsic cues. Critically, this boosting neurogenesis 
  is linked to improvements in cognition: activation of endogenous NSCs through exercise, 
  environmental enrichment, re-feeding, or young blood improves age-related cognitive impairments 
  in mice (Brandhorst et al., 2015; van Praag et al., 2005; Villeda et al., 2011, 2014). The 
  capacity of quiescent NSCs to activate declines during healthy and pathological aging and 
  precedes cognition decline (Capilla-Gonzalez et al., 2014; Enwere et al., 2004; Giachino et 
  al., 2014).Thus, treatments that boost neurogenesis could impact age-related cognitive decline 
  as well as neurodegenerative disease."
- title: AHN in Humans
  content: "AHN in humans. AHN has been established in rodents and other vertebrate for decades, 
  but the existence of this process in human has been controversial until quite recently. Reports 
  using BrdU incorporation (Eriksson et al., 1998), 14C dating (Ernst et al., 2014; Spalding et al., 
  2013) and markers of immature neurons (Boldrini et al., 2018; Moreno-Jiménez et al., 2019; Tobin 
  et al., 2019) have provided independent and corroborating lines of evidence supporting human AHN. 
  Mathematical modeling of 14C birth dating data yielded estimates that in humans, 35% of hippocampal 
  neurons are replaced by newborn neurons during adulthood at a rate of 1.75% per year (Spalding et al., 
  2013). Studies in non-human primates have shown that adult born neurons maintain their immature, 
  highly plastic state for at least 6 months, which is likely to magnify their impact on learning and 
  memory (Kohler 2011). However, it should be noted that another recent report using the same markers 
  for immature neurons failed to detect significant levels of AHN in adult humans (Sorrells et al., 2018). 
  In depth comparison of these studies point to several methodological and sample handling differences 
  that seem likely to explain the failure to detect the markers in the Sorrells work (Kempermann et al., 
  2018; Lucassen et al., 2019). In our view the weight of evidence supports the existence of AHN in humans."
